# eval'ing right

`is_stable_instance` was implemented via `eval`, which fails when resolving names 
from modules. At least, it doestn't work for my test suite. Investigating...

Also, I shouldn't be using `eval`, but rather `getfield`: it takes the module name 
as another parameter.

**Solution** Switching from `eval(mi.def.name)` to `getfiled(mi.def.module, mi.def.name)`
fixed the problem. I seem to be able to test my code in a scenario like the one
we are thinking about (running packages test suite).
