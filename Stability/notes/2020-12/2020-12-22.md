# How To Test

I need to learn how to run a package test suite in the current process â€” so that 
I have all method instances left in my current VM session.

Turns out (thanks Yulia!) the world-age project has a solution for a similar
task (they needed to redefine `eval` for the time of `Pkg.test`) here:

Although the task is different, it may be best to follow their idea and not escape 
the `Pkg.test` sandbox (as I envisioned before: I wanted just `include`
the `runtests.jl`). But then I need to be able to load `Stability` into the sandbox -- **problem**.
E.g. they do `Pkg.add` to get their dependencies in scope. I think it's a bit over pessimistic:
this initiates Pkg's resolver, which is sloppy, every time. It'd be cool to add a path to
`Stability` right away, so that we can just be `using` it.

**Solution** seems to be adding `Stability` to `LOAD_PATH` during creation of
the sandbox.

Another **problem**
is how to right back the results of analysis. I assume, two things are needed:

1) a storable format for results (probably, JSON); 

2) an environment variable `OUPTUT_DIR`. Also, another env variable is probably 
    useful: the name of the package being tested.
