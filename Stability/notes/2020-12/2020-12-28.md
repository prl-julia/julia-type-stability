# Generic types in method instances

When running analysis on the JSON package I got an exception for the method
instance of the following type:

    Tuple{
      typeof(JSON.Parser.int_from_bytes),
      JSON.Parser.ParserContext{DictType,IntType,AllowNanInf,NullValue} 
        where NullValue 
        where AllowNanInf 
        where DictType,
      JSON.Parser.StreamingParserState{IOStream},
      Array{UInt8,1},
      Int64,
      Int64} where IntType<:Real

(So, this is a compiled method of the `int_from_bytes` function.) 
The problem is the outer `where`. My pipeline currently does not know what to do
with it. Interestingly, type stability (as identified by `@code_warntype`)
seems to not depend on this kind of `where`s. E.g.

    julia> f(a :: Vector{Any}) = 1
    f (generic function with 1 method)

    julia> a = ['1', 3.4]
    2-element Array{Any,1}:
      '1': ASCII/Unicode U+0031 (category Nd: Number, decimal digit)
     3.4

    julia> @code_warntype f(a)
    [No warnings]

So a function accepting something like `Vector{T} where T <: Any` (or, simply,
`Vector{Any}`) can be type-stable.

I'm not sure what to do with such types. I could try to manually unwrap `where`s
but this feels a bit hacky. I probably stick to this idea and see how it goes.
