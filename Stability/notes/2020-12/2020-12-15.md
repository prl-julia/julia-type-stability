# Pkg is painful

I probably need to be `using Revise` before loading my package `Stability`
to have the source of Stability updated without reloading anything manually.
So the correct sequence of actions on startup is:

pkg>activate path/to/Stability
julia> using Revise
julia> using Stability

This assumes Revise is in the dependencies of Stability. If not, insert
`pkg>add Revise` as the second command.

# Modules are painful

I want to test MethodInstance-based utilities (`all_mis_of_module` and
`is_stable_instance`) in the test suite of the package. This requires to
defined some `Foo`/`Bar`-modules. When I try to be `using` (or `import`)
those modules, Julia gives me an error about _package_ `Foo` -- which I don't
have, of course!

**Solution**
I should be `using Main.Foo`...
