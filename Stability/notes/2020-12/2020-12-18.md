# Planning a mock of analysis

Today I want to construct a test running just like I wish the future analysis
will run. So, I have a target module at the input, and the invariant that some
of its "interesting" functions have alredy been compiled (basically, called).
As the output I want some sort of report about which functions were there
and weather they hold type stability.

As a first step, I want to add a test for `all_mis_of_module` -- done in fcacb37.

Next up, a function to compute stats for the given module. But, we need a stats
data structure first. What should we include there? Is it as simple as a vector
of data about functions? From the practical point of view, maybe it's handier
to have a map: function-name -> (#all instances, number of stable instances).

I finished with the design. Implement tomorrow.
