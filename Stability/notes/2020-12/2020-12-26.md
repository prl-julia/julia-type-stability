# Hacking into Pkg.test

After reading about World-Age project's approach to overriding `Pkg.test`,
I figured:

* I'm not sure I need sandboxing for package analysis, because `Pkg.test` creates a
  sandbox;

* I need to set environment vriables to send data in the hook inside `Pkg.test`;

* I need to learn how to store `ModuleStats`/`FunctionStats` as JSON.

Regarding the first point: as long as `Pkg.test` don't install (`Pkg.add`),
I probably do need my own sandbox too, after all.

## First prototype

is done as of 9f52b2d. It errors on the JSON package for some reason:

```
ERROR: type UnionAll has no field types
Stacktrace:
