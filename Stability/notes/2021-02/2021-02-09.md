### Looking in the numbers: JSON

* Interestingly, JSON has `src/specialized.jl` usually stable or, at least,
  more stable than their generic versions. 
  
  E.g. `parse_number`: specialized is 81% stable, while generic is 0%. 
  The difference is in that the parser state is concrete (`MemoryParserState`).
  
### Fighting Pluto

I had problems adding CSV package during tests. First, I added CSV in the same environment as the tested package, that failed soemtimes. After that, I tried to start over in a fresh environment. That did not play well with Pluto.

### Fix Module Tracking

I wasn't recording modules right before: I basically record the name of the module I wanted to analyse,
not tha actual module where the method was defined, that's fixed now. 

The purpose was to filter out Base. I'm not sure it's all that good idea anymore: Pluto was
pathological (huge amount of Base utilities), but other packafes seem to be more sane.

Also, this brings interesting insights about how packages are setup. E.g. `DifferentialEquations` have a bunch
of independent packages, while JSON is hierarchical.
