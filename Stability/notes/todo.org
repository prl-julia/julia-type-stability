* Many small TODOs from past meetings
** Empirical Study
*** How to measure timing impact of unstable functions?
**** Attach counters recording number of calls?
**** Use profiler?
*** Do we want to make sure no standard functions get into the stats? Probably
*** Probable bugs
**** 0s in the current tables: constructors are not filtered early enough?
**** Sometimes stable=NaN (division by zero) -- most likely, consequence of previous
**** Pluto fails because of CSV can't install itself
(probably fixed by starting from scratch env?)
*** Nice to have
**** declared types of the methods
**** how unstable is every call: ratio of unstable *slots*
*** Data Analysis We May Be Interested In
**** correlation b/w size and stability
** Formal model
*** How is "surface" language different from IR?
**** One difference: "just calls" on surface become dispatches or direct-calls in IR?
**** What else?
*** Ben thinks that the key is translation between those two â€” why?
*** Do we need two flavours of IR: strongly typed and gradually typed?
- So that we can state the "safe fragment" property.
** Misc
- What does stability mean:
  + in docs
  + in compiler sources
- Are abstract types the same in terms of stability (always unstable) as (nontrivial) unions?
